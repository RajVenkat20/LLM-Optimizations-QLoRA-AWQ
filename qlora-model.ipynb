Why are you here today?\n#Person2#: I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.\n#Person1#: Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\n#Person2#: Ok.\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please.
