Hi, Mr. Smith.

You should have one every year.\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\n#Person2#: Ok.\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.\n#Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.\n\nMr. Smith's getting a check-up, and Doctor Hawkins advises him to have one every year.
